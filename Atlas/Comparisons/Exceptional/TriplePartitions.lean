# The ten complementary-triple partitions of six labels

The objects are actual unordered pairs `{s, sᶜ}` of three-subsets of `Fin 6`.
The symmetric group acts by relabeling, and this action restricts to the actual
alternating group. The marking lists every such object exactly once. Its order
is adapted to the affine coordinates `a + b ω` and infinity on a projective line
over a nine-element field, where `ω² = -1`.

The only finite residual checks enumerate the 64 subsets of six labels, the ten
marked partitions, and the actions of two disjoint three-cycles and a double
transposition. No permutation group enumeration or assumed recognition theorem
is used. Faithfulness follows from the existing simplicity theorem for A6 and
the exhibited nontrivial action.
